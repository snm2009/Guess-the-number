# Guess the even Number 🎯

This is a simple Python project where the computer randomly selects a number, and the player has to guess it. 
The program gives hints such as "Too high" or "Too low" until the correct number is guessed.

## How it works
- The computer chooses a random number.
- The user enters guesses.
- The game tells you if your guess is higher or lower.
- It ends when you guess correctly.

## Features
- Random number generation
- Interactive user input
- Hint system (higher/lower)
- Simple and beginner-friendly code

## How to run
1. Open the `.py` or `.ipynb` file.
2. Run the code in Python or Google Colab.
3. Follow the instructions in the console.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- `random` module (built-in)
